# Cow Movement Analysis Program

Welcome to the Cow Movement Analysis program, written in Python and implemented using a Jupyter notebook!

This program analyzes the movement of cows over the course of 1 year for research purposes in a university course. The data for this analysis is based on a chip that is placed on the cows and records their location in hourly samples throughout the year.
